<h2>History Of How Basketball Was Started</h2>

<p>The game of basketball as is is known today was
created by Dr.james Naismith in December 1891 input
springfield, massachusetts, to condition young
players during a cold month, it consisted of peach
basket and a soccer style ball, he published 13 rules
for the new game.</p>
<p>Basketball is a team sport. Two teams of five players each try to score by shooting a ball through a hoop elevated 10 feet above the ground. The game is played on a rectangular floor called the court, and there is a hoop at each end. The court is divided into two main sections by the mid-court line.</p>
